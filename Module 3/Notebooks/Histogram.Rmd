This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
load("aflsmall.Rdata")
library(lsr)
```
```{r}
who()
```
Doubt: Here for breaks = 3, 4, 5 the number of intervals and their corresponding bars are not intuitively understood.
```{r}
hist(afl.margins, breaks = 3)
hist(afl.margins, breaks = 4)
hist(afl.margins, breaks = 5)
```
Doubt: Here the optimal number of breaks are coming out to be 9, but still it is creating 12 breaks.
```{r}
length(afl.margins)
K = 1 + log(length(afl.margins))/log(2)
K
hist(afl.margins, breaks = 9)
table(afl.margins)


hist( afl.margins, breaks = "Sturges")
```





Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
